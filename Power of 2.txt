Given a non-negative integer n. The task is to check if it is a power of 2. 

Examples

Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 is equal to 2 raised to 3 (23 = 8).
Input: n = 98
Output: false
Explanation: 98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: (20 = 1).
Expected Time Complexity: O(log n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
0 â‰¤ n < 1020

code in java:
class Solution {

    // Function to check if given number n is a power of two.
    public static boolean isPowerofTwo(long n) {

        // Your code here
        if(n<=0)
        {
            return false;
        }
        return (n & (n-1))==0;
    }
}
