Given a number N. Check if it is perfect or not. A number is perfect if sum of factorial of its digit is equal to the given number.

Example 1:

Input: N = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum of factorials of 
digits of 23 is 2! + 3! = 2 + 6 = 8 
which is not equal to 23. Thus, answer 
is 0.
Example 2:

Input: N = 145
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of factorials of digits 
of 145 is 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 
which is equal to 145.Thus, answer is 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function isPerfect() which takes a number N as input parameter and returns 1 if N is perfect.Otherwise, it returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log10N)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(constant)


Constraints:
1<=N<=109

code in java:

class Solution {
    int isPerfect(int N) {
        // code here
        int[] factorial = new int[10];
        factorial[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
            factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;
        }

        // Compute the sum of factorials of the digits of N
        int sumOfFactorials = 0;
        int temp = N;
        
        while (temp > 0) {
            int digit = temp % 10;
            sumOfFactorials += factorial[digit];
            temp /= 10;
        }

        // Check if the sum of factorials equals N
        return (sumOfFactorials == N) ? 1 : 0;

    }
}
