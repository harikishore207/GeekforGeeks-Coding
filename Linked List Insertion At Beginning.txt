Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x, insert that value x at the beginning of the LinkedList and return the modified Linked List.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5 , x = 6
Output: 6->1->2->3->4->5
Explanation: 

We can see that 6 is inserted at the beginning of the linkedlist.
Input: LinkedList: 5->4 , x = 1
Output: 1->5->4
Explanation: 

We can see that 1 is inserted at the beginning of the linkedlist.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data , x <= 103

code in c++:
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to insert a node at the begining of the linked list.
    Node *insertAtBegining(Node *head, int x) {
        // Code here
        Node* temp=new Node(x);
        temp -> next=head;
        head=temp;
        return head;
    }
};
