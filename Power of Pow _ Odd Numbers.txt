Given a single integer N, your task is to find the sum of the square of the first N odd natural Numbers.
 

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 10
Explanation: 12 + 32 = 10
Example 2: 
Input: 3
Output: 35
Explanation: 12 + 32 + 52 = 35
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sum_of_square_oddNumbers() which takes N as the input parameter and returns the sum of the first N odd natural numbers.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000

code in java:

class Solution
{
    public long sum_of_square_oddNumbers(long n)
    {
        // Code here
        long sum=0;
        sum=n*(2*n-1)*(2*n+1);
        sum=sum/3;
        
        return sum;
    }
