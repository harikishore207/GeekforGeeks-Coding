Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively.

Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

Examples

Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) (Recursive).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000



code in c :

void printNos(int N)
{
    //Your code here
    if(N>0){
    printNos(N-1);
    printf("%d ",N);
    }
    return;
    
}
