Create class named Cuboid with fields length,width and height. Calculate volume of the cuboid.
Class Cuboid contains following functions:
1. set_height(int l): sets the length of the cuboid.
2. set_width(int w): sets width of the cuboid.
3. set_height(int h): sets height of the cuboid.
4.volume(): Prints the volume of the cuboid.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, three integers are given.

Output:
For each test case, the output is the volume of the cuboid.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the functions given set_height(), set_width(), set_height() and volume().

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= l, w, h <= 103

Example:
Input
2
10 5 7
11 9 4

Output:
350
396

code in java:

class task
{
    private int length;
    private int width;
    private int height;
    
    public void set_length(int l)
    {
        //Add your code here.
        this.length=l;
    }
    public void set_width(int w)
    {
        //Add your code here.
        this.width=w;
    }
    public void set_height(int h)
    {
        //Add your code here.
        this.height=h;
    }
    public void volume()
    {
        //Add your code here.
        int vol=length*width*height;
        System.out.println(vol);
    }
}
