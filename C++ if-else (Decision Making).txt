Given an integer N. Your task is to check if the integer is greater than, less than or equal to 5.
If the integer is greater than 5, then print "Greater than 5" (without quotes).
If the integer is less than 5, then print "Less than 5".
If the integer is equal to 5, then print "Equal to 5".

Note:- Do not print the next line after the result.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
Output:
Greater than 5
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
Output:
Less than 5
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function compareFive() which takes the number N and returns "Greater than 5" if the integer is greater than 5 or "Less than 5" if the integer is less than 5 otherwise print "Equal to 5" if the integer equals to 5.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000

 

code:

class Solution{
    static String compareFive(int N){
        // code here
        String s1="Greater than 5";
        String s2="Less than 5";
        String s3="Equal to 5";
        if(N>5)
        {
            return s1;
        }
        else if(N<5)
        {
            return s2;
        }
        else
        {
            return s3;
        }
    }
}
